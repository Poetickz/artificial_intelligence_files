## Prediction

### Discussion
Test data need to be feature scaled with the same parameters (mean, standard variance) from the training data, in order to use this data for the prediction. Also a column of 1 needs to be added as the training dataset. With this is possible to obtain the prediction just multiplying the two matrices to obtain the result.


## Times
### Discussion
The table shows that the larger the learning rate, the less iterations and the faster the code runs, but the `w` values ​​are less precise. This is because they perform "bigger jumps" with the largest learning rate.
